## Limitations (Acceptable for This Milestone)

- Basic personalization (no advanced ML-based personalization)
- Simple A/B testing (no statistical analysis yet)
- Limited template variations
- Basic feedback collection (no real-time analytics dashboard yet)
- Feedback analysis will be enhanced in Milestone 12 (Learning Agent)

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Personalization reflects user preferences
- ✅ Different users receive different content styles
- ✅ A/B test variants are properly assigned
- ✅ Email templates render correctly
- ✅ User preferences are saved and applied
- ✅ Feedback buttons appear in each newsletter section
- ✅ Feedback submissions are successfully recorded
- ✅ Feedback is tracked per section and per user

## Next Steps

After this milestone, content is personalized. Milestone 10 will add advanced data sources (earnings, SEC filings).
