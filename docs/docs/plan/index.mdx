title: Development Plan 2026
---

## Overview

This document outlines an incremental development plan for the MediaPulse Media Monitoring Platform throughout 2026. The plan is organized to ensure that **each milestone produces a working end-to-end system**, even if some features are limited or simplified.

## Development Philosophy

Since the system is modular, each part can be developed independently. The plan follows these principles:

1. **Start Simple**: Each component begins with its minimal viable version
2. **Incremental Enhancement**: Features are added progressively to each component
3. **Working System First**: Every milestone produces a functional end-to-end system
4. **Independent Development**: Components can be developed in parallel when dependencies allow
5. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Agents run independently on their own schedules, communicating through a shared database and event queue (see [System Flow](/system-flow) for details)

## Plan Structure

The development plan is organized into incremental milestones:

### Phase 1: Minimal Viable System (Milestones 1-4)

Build the simplest working version of the entire pipeline

- **[Milestone 1: Foundation & Basic Pipeline](/plan/milestone-1-foundation)** - Database, basic scheduler, minimal agents
- **[Milestone 2: First Working Newsletter](/plan/milestone-2-first-newsletter)** - End-to-end newsletter generation with hardcoded data
- **[Milestone 3: Basic Data Collection](/plan/milestone-3-basic-data)** - Single source data collection
- **[Milestone 4: Basic Analysis & Content](/plan/milestone-4-basic-analysis)** - Plugin system infrastructure and initial analysis plugins

### Phase 2: Core Features (Milestones 5-8)

Enhance each component with core functionality

- **[Milestone 5: Query Strategy (Basic)](/plan/milestone-5-query-strategy)** - Entity discovery and query generation
- **[Milestone 6: Enhanced Data Collection](/plan/milestone-6-enhanced-data)** - Multiple sources, deduplication, and agent versioning
- **[Milestone 7: Enhanced Analysis](/plan/milestone-7-enhanced-analysis)** - Additional analysis plugins and enhancements (demonstrates plugin system flexibility)
- **[Milestone 8: Quality Assurance (Basic)](/plan/milestone-8-quality-assurance)** - Basic validation and compliance

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Milestones 9-12)

Add advanced capabilities and optimizations

- **[Milestone 9: Enhanced Content Generation](/plan/milestone-9-enhanced-content)** - Personalization and A/B testing
- **[Milestone 10: Advanced Data Collection](/plan/milestone-10-advanced-data)** - Earnings analysis plugin, SEC filings, advanced processing
- **[Milestone 11: Enhanced Quality Assurance](/plan/milestone-11-enhanced-qa)** - Fact-checking and advanced validation
- **[Milestone 12: Learning Agent (Basic)](/plan/milestone-12-learning)** - Metrics collection and basic optimization

### Phase 4: Production Ready (Milestones 13-14)

Production hardening and continuous improvement

- **[Milestone 13: Production Hardening](/plan/milestone-13-production)** - Monitoring, error handling, scalability
- **[Milestone 14: Advanced Learning](/plan/milestone-14-advanced-learning)** - Advanced analytics and automated optimization

### Supporting Documents

- **[Success Metrics & KPIs](/plan/success-metrics)** - Technical and business metrics for measuring success
- **[Risk Mitigation](/plan/risk-mitigation)** - Technical and business risks with mitigation strategies
- **[Dependencies & Prerequisites](/plan/dependencies)** - External services and team requirements
- **[Review Process](/plan/review-process)** - Milestone review process and notes

## Milestone Progression

Each milestone builds upon the previous ones while maintaining a working system:

## Key Principles

1. **Always Working**: Every milestone produces a deployable, working system
2. **Incremental Value**: Each milestone adds tangible value to users
3. **Parallel Development**: When dependencies allow, components can be developed in parallel
4. **Feature Flags**: Use configuration to enable/disable features as they're developed
5. **Backward Compatible**: New features don't break existing functionality
