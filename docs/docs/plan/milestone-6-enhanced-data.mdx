title: Milestone 6 - Enhanced Data Collection
---

## Summary

Add multiple data sources, improve deduplication, and add relevance scoring.

## Timeline

Weeks 13-14

## Goal

Expand data collection to multiple sources and improve data quality through better deduplication and relevance scoring.

## Deliverables

### Data Collection Agent (Enhanced)

- ✅ **Independent Scheduling** (Maintained):
  - Continues running independently every 1-4 hours (configurable per ticker)
  - High-priority tickers: Every 1 hour
  - Low-priority tickers: Every 6-12 hours
  - Reads latest queries from database (from Query Strategy Agent)
- ✅ **Additional News Sources**:
  - Google News API integration
  - RSS feed parsing (if available)
  - At least 2-3 news sources total
- ✅ **Social Media Integration** (Basic):
  - Twitter/X API integration (v2) - basic search
  - Simple post collection (10-20 posts per ticker)
- ✅ **Improved Deduplication**:
  - AI-powered content similarity (for near-duplicates)
  - Title similarity with fuzzy matching
  - URL normalization
- ✅ **Relevance Scoring**:
  - AI-powered relevance scoring
  - Filter low-relevance content (threshold-based)
  - Score-based prioritization
- ✅ **Source Management**:
  - Source health monitoring
  - Graceful degradation when sources fail
  - Source-specific rate limiting

### Query Strategy Agent (Minor Enhancement)

- ✅ Better query optimization:
  - Track query performance
  - Prioritize high-performing queries

### Agent Versioning System (Basic)

- ✅ **Version Creation and Tracking**:
  - Agent version tables in database
  - Version creation for agent configs and prompts
  - Version metadata (changelog, rationale, expected impact)
  - Version status tracking (draft, experimental, testing, production, deprecated)
- ✅ **Basic Experimentation**:
  - Create experimental versions from production
  - Run test executions on experimental versions
  - Compare experimental vs production performance
  - Basic validation checks before promotion
- ✅ **Deployment System**:
  - Version deployment tracking
  - Rollback capability to previous production version
  - Hot-reload configuration (no downtime)
- ✅ **Admin Dashboard**:
  - Basic version management UI
  - Version comparison tools
  - Deployment controls
  - Simple validation dashboard

**Note**: The Agent Versioning System is a foundational infrastructure feature that enables safe iteration on agent improvements. While it's introduced in this milestone, it will be fully utilized in later milestones (particularly Milestone 14) when the Learning Agent creates optimized versions automatically.

### Database Updates

- ✅ Agent version tables (`AgentVersion`, `AgentVersionDeployment`)
- ✅ Basic experimentation tables (`AgentExperiment`, `AgentValidation`)
- ✅ Version tracking in agent configs

## Limitations (Acceptable for This Milestone)

- Limited social media data (Twitter only, basic search)
- No earnings calls or SEC filings yet
- Basic relevance scoring
- No advanced data enrichment
- Basic versioning (no advanced analytics or automated optimization)
- Manual version promotion (no automated promotion workflows)

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Collects data from 3+ sources
- ✅ Collects 50+ news articles per ticker per day
- ✅ Collects 20+ social media posts per ticker per day
- ✅ Deduplication removes 80%+ of duplicates
- ✅ Relevance scoring filters low-quality content effectively
- ✅ System handles multiple sources gracefully
- ✅ Agent versioning system works correctly
- ✅ Admins can create and test experimental versions
- ✅ Version comparison and rollback function properly

## Next Steps

After this milestone, data collection is robust with multiple sources and agent versioning enables safe iteration on improvements. Milestone 7 will add comprehensive analysis (competitive, sentiment, and event/context analysis).
