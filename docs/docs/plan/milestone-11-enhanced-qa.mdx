title: Milestone 11 - Enhanced Quality Assurance
---

## Summary

Add fact-checking, advanced validation, and automated fix suggestions.

## Timeline

Weeks 23-24

## Goal

Implement comprehensive fact-checking and advanced quality validation.

## Deliverables

### Quality Assurance Agent (Enhanced)

- ✅ **Version-Aware QA Enhancements**:
  - Track quality metrics per agent version
  - Version-specific quality patterns (identify version-related issues)
  - Compare quality scores across versions
  - Version-aware validation rules (different rules for experimental vs production versions)
  - Quality regression detection (identify when new version introduces quality issues)
  - Version performance correlation (link quality issues to specific agent versions)
- ✅ **Fact-Checking System**:
  - Claim extraction from newsletter content
  - Cross-reference with source data
  - Number verification (prices, metrics, dates)
  - Quote and attribution verification
  - AI-powered complex claim verification
  - Fact-checking results linked to source agent version
- ✅ **Advanced Quality Assessment**:
  - Readability analysis
  - Consistency check (contradiction detection)
  - Overall quality score calculation
  - Quality scores tracked per agent version
- ✅ **Issue Resolution**:
  - Automated fix suggestions
  - Severity classification
  - Recommendation generation
  - Version-specific recommendations (suggest version rollback if quality degrades)
- ✅ **Agent Data API Integration**:
  - Writes QA results via `POST /api/quality-assurance/` endpoint
  - Includes `agentVersion` in all outputs
  - Tracks source agent version in validation results

### Content Generation Agent (Update)

- ✅ Use QA feedback more effectively
- ✅ Improve content based on fact-checking results

## Limitations (Acceptable for This Milestone)

- Fact-checking may not catch all subtle errors
- Some fixes require manual intervention
- No automated content rewriting yet

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Version-aware QA tracks quality metrics per agent version
- ✅ Version-specific validation rules work correctly
- ✅ Quality regression detection identifies version-related issues
- ✅ QA results are linked to source agent versions
- ✅ Detects 90%+ of factual errors
- ✅ Verifies numbers and dates accurately
- ✅ Provides actionable fix suggestions
- ✅ Quality scores correlate with manual review
- ✅ Newsletter accuracy improves
- ✅ All QA outputs include `agentVersion` field
- ✅ Version performance correlation helps identify problematic versions

## Next Steps

After this milestone, QA is comprehensive. Milestone 12 will add the Learning Agent for optimization.
