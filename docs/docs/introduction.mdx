## Features

### Data & Intelligence

- **Intelligent Data Collection**: Automatically gathers information from news sites, social media platforms, and public media sources using targeted search queries and intelligent web scraping
- **Entity Intelligence**: Maintains dynamic entity relationship graphs (competitors, suppliers, customers, executives, partners) to enhance search queries and provide comprehensive business context

### AI & Analysis

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized AI agents handle different aspects of the pipeline (data collection, analysis, content generation, quality assurance, delivery, learning) for optimal performance and maintainability
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Performs sentiment analysis to understand public perception, competitive landscape research to monitor what's being said about competitors in the media, and event/context analysis to identify external events (natural disasters, political changes, regulatory updates, economic shifts, social movements) that could affect the company
- **Extensible Plugin System**: Analysis capabilities are built on a plugin-based architecture that allows easy addition, removal, or modification of analysis types without code changes. New analysis types can be registered in the database and automatically integrated into the system
- **Self-Improving System**: Learning agent analyzes user feedback, engagement metrics, and agent performance to continuously optimize content generation strategies
- **Agent Versioning**: Complete version history for all agents with admin-controlled production deployments. Learning agent creates optimized versions automatically, while admins maintain full control over which version runs in production with instant rollback capability

### Content & Personalization

- **Personalized Content**: Generates newsletters tailored to each user's preferences, focus areas, and risk tolerance with customizable detail levels and delivery schedules
- **Executive-Focused Format**: Concise, actionable media insights designed for busy executives who need quick understanding of public perception and media coverage about their companies
- **A/B Testing**: Built-in A/B testing framework allows experimentation with different content styles, structures, and delivery times to maximize engagement

### Quality & Delivery

- **Quality Assurance**: Automated fact-checking, compliance verification, and quality scoring ensure accurate, compliant, and high-quality content before delivery
- **Multi-Channel Delivery**: Delivers newsletters via email and web dashboard with tracking, personalization, and responsive design
- **Interactive Feedback**: Section-level feedback buttons (Like/Dislike, Useful/Irrelevant) allow users to provide granular feedback on newsletter content, enabling continuous improvement and personalization

### Infrastructure & Scalability

- **Database-Driven Configuration**: All system configurations stored in the database for dynamic updates without code deployments
- **Plugin-Based Extensibility**: Analysis types and other capabilities can be extended through a plugin registry system, enabling runtime addition/removal of features without code changes
- **Agent Version Management**: Version control system for agents with production deployment controls, performance tracking per version, and instant rollback capabilities
- **Scalable Architecture**: Queue-based job processing with BullMQ and Redis enables handling multiple tickers and users concurrently

## System Architecture

A modular multi-agent system built with Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Python, and OpenAI, designed for busy executives who need concise, actionable media monitoring insights.

### Core Components

The system consists of **7 specialized agents** and **1 orchestrator component**:

**Agents** (7 types):
1. **Query Strategy Agent** - Maintains entity relationships, generates dynamic search queries, detects trends, and learns from successful content
2. **Data Collection Agent** - Uses queries from Query Strategy Agent to collect data from news sites, social media, and public media sources
3. **Analysis Agent** - Performs analysis using a plugin-based system. By default includes sentiment analysis, competitive landscape research, and event/context analysis. New analysis types can be added by implementing plugin code and registering metadata in the database
4. **Content Generation Agent** - Creates newsletter content using AI with consistent formatting and tone
5. **Quality Assurance Agent** - Validates content quality, fact-checks, and ensures compliance
6. **Delivery Agent** - Handles email delivery and web dashboard updates
7. **Learning Agent** - Tracks metrics, learns from user feedback, optimizes content generation, and creates new agent versions with improvements

**Orchestrator** (core system component, not an agent):
- **Scheduler/Orchestrator** - Manages periodic tasks, job orchestration, and agent instance lifecycle. The orchestrator is a core system component that schedules and coordinates agent execution, but is not itself an agent. See [Architecture](./architecture) for details.

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16+ (App Router) with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Queue System**: BullMQ with Redis for job processing
- **AI Provider**: OpenAI (GPT-4) with fallback support
- **Email**: Resend or SendGrid
- **Web Scraping**: Playwright for dynamic content, Cheerio for static
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js for user management
- **Monitoring**: Custom metrics dashboard + error tracking
