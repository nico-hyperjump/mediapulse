title: Milestone 6 - Enhanced Data Collection
---

## Summary

Add multiple data sources, improve deduplication, and add relevance scoring.

## Timeline

Weeks 13-14

## Goal

Expand data collection to multiple sources and improve data quality through better deduplication and relevance scoring.

## Deliverables

### Data Collection Agent (Enhanced)

- ✅ **Independent Scheduling** (Maintained):
  - Continues running independently every 1-4 hours (configurable per ticker)
  - High-priority tickers: Every 1 hour
  - Low-priority tickers: Every 6-12 hours
  - Reads latest queries from database (from Query Strategy Agent)
- ✅ **Additional News Sources**:
  - Google News API integration
  - RSS feed parsing (if available)
  - At least 2-3 news sources total
- ✅ **Social Media Integration** (Basic):
  - Twitter/X API integration (v2) - basic search
  - Simple post collection (10-20 posts per ticker)
- ✅ **Improved Deduplication**:
  - AI-powered content similarity (for near-duplicates)
  - Title similarity with fuzzy matching
  - URL normalization
- ✅ **Relevance Scoring**:
  - AI-powered relevance scoring
  - Filter low-relevance content (threshold-based)
  - Score-based prioritization
- ✅ **Source Management**:
  - Source health monitoring
  - Graceful degradation when sources fail
  - Source-specific rate limiting

### Query Strategy Agent (Minor Enhancement)

- ✅ Better query optimization:
  - Track query performance
  - Prioritize high-performing queries

### Agent Versioning System (Basic)

- ✅ **Version Creation and Tracking**:
  - Agent version tables in database
  - Version creation for agent configs and prompts
  - Version metadata (changelog, rationale, expected impact)
  - Version status tracking (draft, experimental, testing, production, deprecated)
- ✅ **Basic Experimentation**:
  - Create experimental versions from production
  - Run test executions on experimental versions
  - Compare experimental vs production performance
  - Basic validation checks before promotion
- ✅ **Deployment System**:
  - Version deployment tracking
  - Rollback capability to previous production version
  - Hot-reload configuration (no downtime)
- ✅ **Admin Dashboard**:
  - Basic version management UI
  - Version comparison tools
  - Deployment controls
  - Simple validation dashboard

### Database Updates

- ✅ Agent version tables (`AgentVersion`, `AgentVersionDeployment`)
- ✅ Basic experimentation tables (`AgentExperiment`, `AgentValidation`)
- ✅ Version tracking in agent configs

## Limitations (Acceptable for This Milestone)

- Limited social media data (Twitter only, basic search)
- No earnings calls or SEC filings yet
- Basic relevance scoring
- No advanced data enrichment
- Basic versioning (no advanced analytics or automated optimization)
- Manual version promotion (no automated promotion workflows)

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Collects data from 3+ sources
- ✅ Collects 50+ news articles per ticker per day
- ✅ Collects 20+ social media posts per ticker per day
- ✅ Deduplication removes 80%+ of duplicates
- ✅ Relevance scoring filters low-quality content effectively
- ✅ System handles multiple sources gracefully
- ✅ Agent versioning system works correctly
- ✅ Admins can create and test experimental versions
- ✅ Version comparison and rollback function properly

## Next Steps

After this milestone, data collection is robust with multiple sources and agent versioning enables safe iteration on improvements. Milestone 7 will add comprehensive analysis (fundamental, competitive, advanced technical).
