## Limitations (Acceptable for This Milestone)

- Simple peer comparison (no complex industry analysis)
- Basic event identification (no deep impact modeling)
- Event relevance scoring may need refinement
- Plugin system supports basic plugin interface (advanced plugin features in later milestones)

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Competitive analysis plugin is registered and functional
- ✅ All analysis plugins (sentiment, competitive, event) are calculated and stored
- ✅ Plugin system demonstrates flexibility (new plugin added without core code changes)
- ✅ Peer comparisons are relevant
- ✅ Events are identified accurately with appropriate relevance scores
- ✅ Newsletters dynamically include sections for all registered analysis plugins
- ✅ Insights are actionable and relevant
- ✅ Content generation adapts automatically to available analysis plugins

## Next Steps

After this milestone, analysis is comprehensive with three registered plugins. The plugin system infrastructure is proven and ready for additional analysis types. Milestone 8 will add quality assurance to validate content before delivery. Milestone 10 will add an Earnings Analysis plugin, further expanding the analysis capabilities.
