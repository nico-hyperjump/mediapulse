title: Milestone 12 - Learning Agent (Basic)
---

## Summary

Implement basic learning agent to collect metrics and provide optimization recommendations.

## Timeline

Weeks 25-26

## Goal

Add metrics collection and basic optimization capabilities.

## Deliverables

### Learning Agent (Basic)

- ✅ **Independent Scheduling**:
  - Runs on its own schedule: Daily at midnight
  - Operates independently - analyzes all metrics from previous day
- ✅ **Metrics Collection**:
  - Engagement metrics (opens, clicks, time spent)
  - User feedback collection (ratings, comments)
  - Newsletter performance tracking
  - Agent performance metrics
- ✅ **Basic Analysis**:
  - Engagement rate calculations
  - Trend detection
  - Top/low performing content identification
- ✅ **Optimization Recommendations**:
  - Basic config optimization suggestions
  - Simple A/B test analysis
  - Performance improvement recommendations
  - Updates agent configs in database (hot-reloadable)

### Database Updates

- ✅ User feedback table (if not exists)
- ✅ Agent metrics table (if not exists)
- ✅ Engagement tracking

### Web Dashboard Updates

- ✅ Feedback collection UI (ratings, comments)
- ✅ Basic analytics dashboard
- ✅ Admin metrics view

### Delivery Agent (Update)

- ✅ Email tracking (open tracking, click tracking)
- ✅ Engagement metrics collection

## Limitations (Acceptable for This Milestone)

- Basic metrics only (no advanced analytics)
- Simple recommendations (no automated updates)
- No statistical significance testing for A/B tests
- Manual review of recommendations

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Collects engagement metrics accurately
- ✅ Tracks user feedback
- ✅ Generates basic optimization recommendations
- ✅ A/B test results are tracked
- ✅ Metrics dashboard displays data correctly

## Next Steps

After this milestone, system collects metrics. Milestone 13 will focus on production hardening.
