## Quarterly Review Process

At the end of each quarter:

1. **Milestone Review**: Assess completion of all deliverables
2. **Retrospective**: Identify what went well and what needs improvement
3. **Adjustments**: Update plan for next quarter based on learnings
4. **Stakeholder Demo**: Demonstrate progress to stakeholders
5. **Resource Planning**: Ensure adequate resources for next quarter

## Notes

- This plan assumes a team of 4-6 engineers working full-time
- Milestones may be adjusted based on learnings and priorities
- Some work may proceed in parallel across different team members
- External dependencies (API access, approvals) should be secured early
- Regular communication and alignment meetings are critical for success
