## Milestone Review Process

At the completion of each milestone:

1. **Milestone Review**: Assess completion of all deliverables
2. **System Verification**: Verify the system works end-to-end (even with limitations)
3. **Retrospective**: Identify what went well and what needs improvement
4. **Adjustments**: Update plan for next milestone based on learnings
5. **Stakeholder Demo**: Demonstrate working system to stakeholders
6. **Resource Planning**: Ensure adequate resources for next milestone

### Phase Reviews

At the completion of each phase (after every 4 milestones):

1. **Phase Retrospective**: Comprehensive review of phase progress
2. **System Assessment**: Evaluate overall system capabilities and limitations
3. **Priority Adjustment**: Adjust priorities for next phase if needed
4. **Major Demo**: Full system demonstration with all current features

## Notes

- This plan assumes a team of 4-6 engineers working full-time
- Milestones may be adjusted based on learnings and priorities
- Some work may proceed in parallel across different team members
- External dependencies (API access, approvals) should be secured early
- Regular communication and alignment meetings are critical for success
