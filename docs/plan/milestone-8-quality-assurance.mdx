title: Milestone 8 - Quality Assurance (Basic)
---

## Summary

Add basic quality assurance to validate newsletters before delivery.

## Timeline

Weeks 17-18

## Goal

Implement basic quality checks and compliance validation to ensure newsletter quality.

## Deliverables

### Quality Assurance Agent (Basic)

- ✅ **Agent Versioning**:
  - Reads active version from `AgentVersionDeployment` table during initialization
  - Includes `agentVersion` field in all outputs
  - Version information stored in `AgentVersion` table
- ✅ **Agent Registration**:
  - Registers agent type metadata via Agent Registry API (`POST /api/registry/register/`)
  - Registers instance via Agent Registry API (`POST /api/register/`) when spawned by orchestrator
  - Reports heartbeat via Agent Registry API (`POST /api/heartbeat/`) with current load and status
- ✅ **Version-Aware QA**:
  - Tracks which agent version generated the content being validated
  - Validates content with awareness of source agent version
  - Can apply version-specific validation rules
  - Records validation results with source agent version information
- ✅ **Basic Quality Checks**:
  - Content completeness (required sections present)
  - Length validation (not too short/long)
  - Basic grammar/spelling check (using AI)
  - Consistency check (no obvious contradictions)
- ✅ **Compliance Checking**:
  - Disclaimer verification (required disclaimers present)
  - Financial advice language detection
  - Data attribution verification
- ✅ **Approval Workflow**:
  - Pass/fail decision logic
  - Auto-approval for high-quality content
  - Flag for manual review if issues found
  - Writes approval status via Agent Data API (`POST /api/quality-assurance/`)
  - Includes `agentVersion` in all outputs
- ✅ **Integration with Pipeline**:
  - QA runs after content generation (orchestrator invokes QA HTTP endpoint)
  - Can request revision from Content Generation Agent (via orchestrator)
  - Blocks delivery if not approved

### Content Generation Agent (Minor Update)

- ✅ Handle revision requests from QA
- ✅ Improve content based on QA feedback

### Hermes Orchestrator (Update)

- ✅ Include QA stage in pipeline (invokes QA Agent HTTP endpoint)
- ✅ Handle QA approval/rejection flow
- ✅ Tracks QA job execution in `AgentJobExecution` table
- ✅ Can trigger Content Generation Agent revision if QA requests it

## Limitations (Acceptable for This Milestone)

- Basic fact-checking only (no cross-referencing with sources)
- Simple quality checks (no advanced validation)
- No automated fix suggestions
- Manual review for complex issues

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Agent versioning is functional for QA Agent (agent reads active version, includes in outputs)
- ✅ Agent registration is functional (agent registers type and instance, reports heartbeat)
- ✅ Version-aware QA tracks source agent versions in validation results
- ✅ QA Agent validates newsletter content via HTTP endpoint
- ✅ QA writes outputs via Agent Data API with `agentVersion` field
- ✅ Catches obvious quality issues
- ✅ Compliance checks work correctly
- ✅ Approval workflow functions properly
- ✅ Revision requests improve content quality
- ✅ Low-quality content is blocked from delivery

## Next Steps

After this milestone, newsletters are validated before delivery. Milestone 9 will add personalization and A/B testing to content generation.
