## Limitations (Acceptable for This Milestone)

- Basic fact-checking only (no cross-referencing with sources)
- Simple quality checks (no advanced validation)
- No automated fix suggestions
- Manual review for complex issues

## Success Criteria

- ✅ QA Agent validates newsletter content
- ✅ Catches obvious quality issues
- ✅ Compliance checks work correctly
- ✅ Approval workflow functions properly
- ✅ Revision requests improve content quality
- ✅ Low-quality content is blocked from delivery

## Next Steps

After this milestone, newsletters are validated before delivery. Milestone 9 will add personalization and A/B testing to content generation.
