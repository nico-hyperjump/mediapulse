title: Milestone 8 - Quality Assurance (Basic)
---

## Summary

Add basic quality assurance to validate newsletters before delivery.

## Timeline

Weeks 17-18

## Goal

Implement basic quality checks and compliance validation to ensure newsletter quality.

## Deliverables

### Quality Assurance Agent (Basic)

- ✅ **Basic Quality Checks**:
  - Content completeness (required sections present)
  - Length validation (not too short/long)
  - Basic grammar/spelling check (using AI)
  - Consistency check (no obvious contradictions)
- ✅ **Compliance Checking**:
  - Disclaimer verification (required disclaimers present)
  - Financial advice language detection
  - Data attribution verification
- ✅ **Approval Workflow**:
  - Pass/fail decision logic
  - Auto-approval for high-quality content
  - Flag for manual review if issues found
- ✅ **Integration with Pipeline**:
  - QA runs after content generation
  - Can request revision from Content Generation Agent
  - Blocks delivery if not approved

### Content Generation Agent (Minor Update)

- ✅ Handle revision requests from QA
- ✅ Improve content based on QA feedback

### Scheduler Agent (Update)

- ✅ Include QA stage in pipeline
- ✅ Handle QA approval/rejection flow

## Limitations (Acceptable for This Milestone)

- Basic fact-checking only (no cross-referencing with sources)
- Simple quality checks (no advanced validation)
- No automated fix suggestions
- Manual review for complex issues

## Success Criteria

- ✅ QA Agent validates newsletter content
- ✅ Catches obvious quality issues
- ✅ Compliance checks work correctly
- ✅ Approval workflow functions properly
- ✅ Revision requests improve content quality
- ✅ Low-quality content is blocked from delivery

## Next Steps

After this milestone, newsletters are validated before delivery. Milestone 9 will add personalization and A/B testing to content generation.
