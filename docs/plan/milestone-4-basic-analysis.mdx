Add basic analysis capabilities and improve content generation with insights.

## Timeline

Weeks 9-10

## Goal

Add simple analysis (sentiment and basic technical) and enhance content generation to include insights.

## Deliverables

### Analysis Agent (Minimal)

- ✅ **Sentiment Analysis**:

  - Simple sentiment trend (improving/declining/stable)
- ✅ **Basic Technical Analysis**:
  - Price change calculation
  - Simple moving average (if historical data available)
  - Volume analysis (high/normal/low)
- ✅ Analysis result storage:
  - Store analysis results in database
  - Link to source data
- ✅ Simple insight extraction:
  - Identify top 3 insights from analysis
  - Priority scoring (basic)

### Content Generation Agent (Enhanced)

- ✅ Enhanced newsletter structure:
  - Executive summary with sentiment

### Database Updates

- ✅ Link analysis to newsletters

### Scheduler Agent (Update)

- ✅ Newsletter pipeline enhancements:

## Limitations (Acceptable for This Milestone)

- Only sentiment and basic technical analysis
- No fundamental analysis
- No competitive analysis

- ✅ Sentiment scores are calculated and stored
- ✅ Basic technical indicators are calculated
- ✅ Content generation includes analysis insights
- ✅ Newsletters show sentiment and basic technical data
- ✅ Insights are relevant and actionable

## Next Steps

After this milestone, newsletters include basic analysis. Milestone 5 will add query strategy to improve data collection quality and discover entities.
