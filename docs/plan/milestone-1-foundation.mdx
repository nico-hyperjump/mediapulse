title: Milestone 1 - Foundation & Basic Pipeline
---

## Summary

Establish the technical foundation and build the minimal agent framework to support the pipeline.

## Timeline

Weeks 1-4

## Goal

Create the database foundation, basic agent framework, and minimal scheduler that can orchestrate a simple pipeline.

## Deliverables

### Database & Infrastructure

- ✅ Monorepo structure with Turborepo configured
- ✅ PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM setup
- ✅ **Minimal database schema** (only essential tables):
  - `User` - Basic user information
  - `Ticker` - Stock symbols
  - `UserTicker` - User-ticker subscriptions
  - `Newsletter` - Generated newsletters
  - `NewsletterContent` - Newsletter content (simple text field)
  - `AgentConfig` - Basic configuration storage
- ✅ Database migrations and seed scripts
- ✅ Redis setup for BullMQ queue system
- ✅ Environment variable management

### Agent Framework (Minimal)

- ✅ Base Agent class with:
  - Error handling
  - Basic logging
  - Configuration loading from database
  - Independent scheduling support (each agent can have its own schedule)
- ✅ Agent registry system
- ✅ Job queue system with BullMQ:
  - Basic queue setup
  - Job creation and processing
  - Simple retry mechanism
  - Support for independent agent scheduling
- ✅ Event-driven communication foundation:
  - Agents communicate through shared database (not direct calls)
  - Data timestamping for freshness tracking

### Scheduler Agent (Minimal)

- ✅ Basic scheduler that can:
  - Run on a schedule (cron or interval) - default daily at 6 AM
  - Create jobs for user-ticker combinations
  - Execute a simple 3-stage newsletter pipeline:
    1. Data Collection (placeholder - returns hardcoded data)
    2. Content Generation (placeholder - generates simple text)
    3. Delivery (placeholder - saves to database only)
  - Check data freshness before processing (basic check)
- ✅ Sequential execution (no parallelism yet)
- ✅ Basic error handling

### Web Application (Minimal)

- ✅ Next.js 16+ App Router application (`apps/web/`)
- ✅ NextAuth.js authentication (email/password only)
- ✅ Basic dashboard page (`/dashboard`) that:
  - Shows user information
  - Lists newsletters (if any exist)
- ✅ Database package (`packages/database/`) with Prisma client

### Shared Packages

- ✅ `packages/shared/` - Basic types and utilities
- ✅ Basic logging infrastructure

## Limitations (Acceptable for This Milestone)

- No actual data collection (uses hardcoded data)
- No analysis (skipped)
- No quality assurance (skipped)
- No email delivery (only saves to database)
- No personalization
- Sequential execution only (no parallelism)
- Basic error handling only

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Database schema created and migrations run successfully
- ✅ Scheduler can be triggered manually and runs the 3-stage pipeline
- ✅ Placeholder agents execute and produce output
- ✅ Newsletter is saved to database
- ✅ User can log in and see their dashboard
- ✅ Newsletter appears in dashboard (even if content is placeholder)

## Next Steps

After this milestone, the system can run end-to-end (with placeholder data). Milestone 2 will replace placeholders with actual functionality.
