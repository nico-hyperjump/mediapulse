## Milestone 1.1

### Summary

Project Setup & Database Foundation

### Timeline

Weeks 1-4

### Goal

Establish the technical foundation and database schema for the entire system.

### Deliverables

- ✅ PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM setup
- ✅ Complete database schema implementation:
  - User, Ticker, UserTicker models
  - DataSource model for collected data
  - Newsletter and NewsletterContent models
  - UserFeedback and AgentMetrics models
  - ABTest model
  - Configuration tables: AgentConfig, SourceConfig, UserPreferences, SystemConfig, ABTestConfig
- ✅ Database migrations and seed scripts
- ✅ Redis setup for BullMQ queue system
- ✅ Environment variable management and configuration
- ✅ Basic CI/CD pipeline setup
- ✅ Development environment documentation

### Success Criteria

## Milestone 1.2

### Summary

Core Agent Framework & Configuration System

### Timeline

Weeks 5-8

### Goal

Build the foundational agent architecture and dynamic configuration management system.

### Deliverables

- ✅ Base Agent class with common functionality (error handling, retries, logging)
- ✅ Configuration management system:
  - Database-driven config loading
  - Config caching with TTL
  - Hot-reload API endpoint
  - Config versioning and rollback
  - Configuration hierarchy resolution (user → ticker → agent → system)
  - Zod schema validation for all configs
- ✅ Agent registry and execution framework
- ✅ Job queue system with BullMQ:
  - Queue setup and configuration
  - Job types and priorities
  - Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
  - Job monitoring and status tracking
- ✅ Scheduler Agent implementation:
  - Pipeline orchestration (data collection → analysis → content generation → QA → delivery)
  - Cron-based and interval-based scheduling
  - Job creation and prioritization per user-ticker combination
  - Parallel execution management (parallel data collection/analysis, sequential content generation per user)
  - Stage-level error handling and retries
  - Pipeline metrics collection and reporting
- ✅ Shared types package (`packages/shared/`)
- ✅ Logging and monitoring infrastructure
- ✅ Unit tests for agent framework (80%+ coverage)

### Success Criteria

- Agents can be instantiated and configured from database
- Configuration changes apply without code deployment
- Job queue processes jobs successfully
- Scheduler Agent can orchestrate multi-stage pipeline execution
- Scheduler Agent handles parallel and sequential execution correctly
- All framework code has comprehensive test coverage

## Milestone 1.3

### Summary

Build the core Next.js web application with authentication and basic UI.

### Timeline

Weeks 9-12

### Goal

Build the core Next.js web application with authentication and basic UI.

- ✅ Next.js 16+ App Router application (`apps/web/`)
- ✅ NextAuth.js authentication setup:
  - Email/password authentication
  - OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)
  - Session management
  - Protected routes
- ✅ Core dashboard pages:
  - `/dashboard` - Overview page with layout
  - `/auth/login` and `/auth/signup` pages
  - `/settings` - User preferences page (UI only)
- ✅ Database package (`packages/database/`) with Prisma client exports
- ✅ UI component library foundation:
  - Design system setup (Tailwind CSS or similar)
  - Reusable components (Button, Card, Input, etc.)
  - Responsive layout components
- ✅ API route structure for future endpoints
- ✅ Basic error handling and loading states

### Success Criteria

- Users can sign up, log in, and access dashboard
- Dashboard displays basic user information
- All pages are responsive and accessible
- Authentication flow works end-to-end
