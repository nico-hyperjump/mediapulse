## Technical Risks

- **API Rate Limits**: Implement robust rate limiting and multiple provider fallbacks
- **AI Cost Overruns**: Monitor token usage, implement caching, optimize prompts
- **Data Quality Issues**: Multiple validation layers, human review for critical content
- **Scalability Challenges**: Load testing early, design for horizontal scaling

## Business Risks

- **User Adoption**: Beta testing program, iterative improvements based on feedback
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Legal review, compliance checks built into QA agent
- **Market Data Costs**: Monitor usage, negotiate bulk pricing, implement caching
