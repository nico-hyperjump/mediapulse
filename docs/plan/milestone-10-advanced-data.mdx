## Limitations (Acceptable for This Milestone)

- Basic transcript processing (no deep Q&A analysis)
- Simple entity extraction from filings
- No complex relationship mapping

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Successfully retrieves earnings transcripts
- ✅ Extracts key metrics with 90%+ accuracy
- ✅ Processes SEC filings and extracts entities
- ✅ Earnings analysis plugin is registered and functional
- ✅ Earnings insights are dynamically included in newsletters (when plugin results available)
- ✅ Plugin system demonstrates ease of adding new analysis types
- ✅ Entity discovery improves with filing data

## Next Steps

After this milestone, data collection includes earnings and filings. The plugin system now supports four analysis plugins (sentiment, competitive, event, earnings), demonstrating the flexibility to add new analysis capabilities without core code changes. Milestone 11 will enhance QA with fact-checking.
