title: Milestone 3 - Basic Data Collection
---

## Summary

Replace mock data with real data collection from a single, simple source.

## Timeline

Weeks 7-8

## Goal

Implement real data collection from one reliable source (NewsAPI) to replace hardcoded data.

## Deliverables

### Data Collection Agent (Enhanced)

- ✅ **Independent Scheduling**:
  - Runs on its own schedule (every 2-4 hours by default, configurable per ticker)
  - Operates independently - doesn't wait for other agents
  - Reads latest queries from database (when available)
- ✅ **NewsAPI integration**:
  - API client setup
  - Basic query construction (ticker name search)
  - Article fetching and parsing
  - Rate limiting handling
- ✅ **Basic market data**:
  - Alpha Vantage API integration (or Yahoo Finance)
  - Price, change, volume data
  - Simple error handling
- ✅ Data storage to `DataSource` table:
  - News articles with metadata
  - Market data with timestamps
  - Timestamps for freshness tracking
- ✅ Basic deduplication:
  - URL-based deduplication
  - Title similarity (simple string matching)
- ✅ Error handling:
  - API failure handling
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Graceful degradation (return partial data if some sources fail)

### Query Strategy (Minimal - Hardcoded)

- ✅ Simple query generation:
  - Ticker name → search query (e.g., "AAPL" → "Apple Inc")
  - No entity discovery yet
  - No query optimization yet
- ✅ Hardcoded query templates

## Limitations (Acceptable for This Milestone)

- Only one news source (NewsAPI)
- No social media data
- No earnings or SEC filings
- Simple query generation (ticker name only)
- Basic deduplication only
- No relevance scoring

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Collects 10+ real news articles per ticker per day
- ✅ Fetches accurate market data
- ✅ Data is stored correctly in database
- ✅ Deduplication removes obvious duplicates
- ✅ Newsletter content uses real collected data
- ✅ System handles API failures gracefully

## Next Steps

After this milestone, newsletters use real data from one source. Milestone 4 will add basic analysis to provide insights beyond just news summaries.
