## Executive Summary

MediaPulse is an intelligent, multi-agent platform designed to deliver personalized media monitoring insights to busy executives who own or manage companies. The system automatically collects data from multiple sources (news sites, social media, public media), performs comprehensive analysis (sentiment and competitive landscape), and generates executive-friendly newsletters tailored to each user's preferences.

Built with modern technologies including Next.js, TypeScript, and OpenAI's GPT-4, the system employs a modular architecture where specialized AI agents work together to transform raw media data into concise, high-quality media intelligence. The platform continuously learns and improves through user feedback, engagement metrics, and A/B testing, ensuring that the content quality and relevance improve over time.

The system is designed for scalability and reliability, with robust error handling, retry mechanisms, and comprehensive monitoring. All configurations are stored in the database and can be updated dynamically without code changes, making it easy to adapt to changing market conditions and user needs.

## Quick Start

This documentation is organized into the following sections:

### Core Documentation

- **[Introduction](./introduction)** - Overview, features, system architecture, and technical stack
- **[Architecture](./architecture)** - Project structure, database schema, and configuration management
- **[System Flow](./system-flow)** - Complete workflow, implementation details, and environment setup

### Agent Documentation

The system consists of **7 specialized agents** that work together, orchestrated by the **Scheduler/Orchestrator**:

**Agents**:
1. **[Query Strategy Agent](./agents/agent-query-strategy)** - Entity discovery, query generation, and optimization
2. **[Data Collection Agent](./agents/agent-data-collection)** - Multi-source data collection with intelligent filtering
3. **[Analysis Agent](./agents/agent-analysis)** - Sentiment, competitive, and event/context analysis
4. **[Content Generation Agent](./agents/agent-content-generation)** - Personalized newsletter creation
5. **[Quality Assurance Agent](./agents/agent-quality-assurance)** - Content validation and compliance checking
6. **[Delivery Agent](./agents/agent-delivery)** - Email and dashboard delivery with tracking
7. **[Learning Agent](./agents/agent-learning)** - Metrics analysis, optimization, and A/B testing

**Orchestrator** (core system component, not an agent):
- **[Scheduler/Orchestrator](./agents/agent-scheduler)** - Pipeline orchestration, job scheduling, and agent instance management. The orchestrator is a core system component that coordinates agent execution but is not itself an agent.

### Plan Documentation

- **[Plan](./plan)** - Project plan, timeline, and deliverables
- **[Q1](./plan/q1-foundation)** - Foundation and core infrastructure
- **[Q2](./plan/q2-data-collection)** - Data collection and analysis
- **[Q3](./plan/q3-analysis-content)** - Analysis and content generation
- **[Q4](./plan/q4-delivery-production)** - Delivery and production
- **[Success Metrics](./plan/success-metrics)** - Technical and business metrics for measuring success
- **[Risk Mitigation](./plan/risk-mitigation)** - Technical and business risks with mitigation strategies
- **[Dependencies & Prerequisites](./plan/dependencies)** - External services and team requirements
- **[Review Process](./plan/review-process)** - Quarterly review process and notes
